1. Identifying the Core Classes*

To model the IRCTC ticket booking system, we'll identify the primary entities involved in the process:

- *User*
- *Ticket*
- *Train*
- *Seat*
- *Payment*
- *Booking*
- *Schedule*
- *Station*

Each of these classes represents a real-world entity or concept within the system.

---

### *2. Encapsulation: Class Attributes and Methods*

We'll define each class with its attributes (variables) and methods (functions), ensuring encapsulation by keeping attributes private and providing public methods to access and modify them.

#### *a. User Class*

Represents a user of the system.

*Attributes:*

- userID: String
- name: String
- email: String
- phoneNumber: String
- password: String
- bookings: Array of Booking

*Methods:*

- register()
- login()
- logout()
- updateProfile()
- viewBookings()

#### *b. Train Class*

Represents a train in the system.

*Attributes:*

- trainID: String
- trainName: String
- trainType: String (e.g., Express, Superfast)
- seats: Array of Seat
- schedule: Schedule

*Methods:*

- getSeatAvailability()
- getSchedule()
- getTrainInfo()

#### *c. Seat Class*

Represents a seat in a train.

*Attributes:*

- seatNumber: String
- classType: String (e.g., First AC, Sleeper)
- isBooked: Boolean

*Methods:*

- bookSeat()
- cancelSeat()
- checkAvailability()

#### *d. Booking Class*

Represents a ticket booking made by a user.

*Attributes:*

- bookingID: String
- user: User
- train: Train
- seat: Seat
- originStation: Station
- destinationStation: Station
- bookingDate: Date
- travelDate: Date
- payment: Payment

*Methods:*

- createBooking()
- cancelBooking()
- viewBookingDetails()

#### *e. Payment Class*

Handles payment processing.

*Attributes:*

- paymentID: String
- amount: Double
- paymentDate: Date
- paymentStatus: String
- paymentMethod: String (e.g., Credit Card, UPI)

*Methods:*

- processPayment()
- refundPayment()
- getPaymentStatus()

#### *f. Schedule Class*

Represents the schedule of a train.

*Attributes:*

- scheduleID: String
- train: Train
- arrivalTimes: Map of Station to Date
- departureTimes: Map of Station to Date

*Methods:*

- getArrivalTime(Station station)
- getDepartureTime(Station station)
- updateSchedule()

#### *g. Station Class*

Represents a train station.

*Attributes:*

- stationID: String
- stationName: String
- location: String (City/State)

*Methods:*

- getStationInfo()

---

### *3. Array Implementation*

Arrays, or more appropriately, array-based data structures, can be used to store collections of objects like seats, bookings, trains, etc.

- *Seats Array in Train Class:*

  The seats attribute in the Train class is an array of Seat objects. This array represents all the seats available on a train. Using an array allows for efficient access and management of seat availability.

  java
  Seat[] seats = new Seat[totalSeats];
  

- *Bookings Array in User Class:*

  The bookings attribute in the User class is an array of Booking objects. This keeps track of all bookings made by a user.

  java
  Booking[] bookings = new Booking[maxBookings];

### *4. UML Class Diagram*

Below is a textual representation of the UML class diagram for our system.

### *5. Deep Dive into Class Interactions*

#### *User and Booking:*

- The User class has an array of Booking objects, representing all bookings made by the user.
- Methods in User class like viewBookings() utilize this array to display booking history.

#### *Train and Seat:*

- Each Train has an array of Seat objects, signifying all the seats it contains.
- The getSeatAvailability() method checks the isBooked status in the Seat array.

#### *Booking Process Flow:*

1. *User Authentication:*

   - User registers and logs in using register() and login() methods in User class.

2. *Searching for Trains:*

   - User searches for available trains, possibly through a method like searchTrains() (could be part of another class or service).

3. *Selecting Seats:*

   - User selects a Seat from the available seats in the Train's seats array.

4. *Creating a Booking:*

   - A Booking object is created with all relevant details.
   - The createBooking() method in Booking class handles this process.

5. *Processing Payment:*

   - Payment is processed using the processPayment() method in the Payment class.

6. *Updating Seat Status:*

   - Upon successful payment, the isBooked status of the Seat is updated to true.

---

### *6. Encapsulation and Data Hiding*

Encapsulation ensures that the internal representation of an object is hidden from the outside:

- *Private Attributes:*

  - All class attributes are private, meaning they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

- *Public Methods:*

  - Public methods like getSeatAvailability(), bookSeat(), and createBooking() provide controlled access to modify or retrieve data.

---

### *7. Possible Extension: Using Arrays in Implementation*

Arrays can be used to implement:

- *Seat Allocation:*

  - A 2D array can represent seat layouts, especially for trains with multiple coaches.

  java
  Seat[][] seats = new Seat[coaches][seatsPerCoach];
  

- *Waitlist Management:*

  - An array or queue can manage waitlisted passengers when all seats are booked.

---

### *8. Metaphor for Understanding the System*

Think of the IRCTC booking system as a library:

- *Library (System):*

  - Holds books (seats) organized on shelves (trains).

- *Member (User):*

  - Has a membership ID (userID) and can borrow books (bookSeat()).

- *Book (Seat):*

  - Can be borrowed (booked) or available.

- *Catalog (Schedule):*

  - Helps locate books (seats) and know if they're available.

This analogy helps visualize how users interact with the system to book tickets.

---

### *9. Anticipating Further Questions*

- *How to handle cancellations?*

  - The cancelBooking() method in Booking class handles cancellations, including updating seat availability and processing refunds.

- *How to ensure thread safety in concurrent bookings?*

  - Implement synchronization mechanisms to prevent race conditions when multiple users try to book the same seat simultaneously.

- *How to extend the system for different transportation modes?*

  - Use inheritance or interfaces to create base classes (e.g., Vehicle) and extend them for trains, buses, etc.

---

### *10. Conclusion*

By identifying these classes and understanding their interactions, we've laid the groundwork for designing an effective IRCTC ticket booking system. The UML class diagram and encapsulated classes ensure a scalable, maintainable, and efficient implementation.
